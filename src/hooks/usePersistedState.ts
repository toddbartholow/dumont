/**
 * useState whose value is loaded once from a persistence getter and written back
 * via a setter whenever it changes. Collapses the repeated
 *   const [x, setX] = useState(() => getX());
 *   useEffect(() => { persistX(x); }, [x]);
 * pattern into a single declaration.
 *
 * `load` runs once (state initializer). `persist` runs on every change, AND on
 * mount — writing the loaded value straight back is an idempotent no-op, matching
 * the behavior of the hand-written effects this replaces. `persist` is expected
 * to be a stable module-level function; it's listed as a dep so a changed
 * identity re-persists the current value (harmless) rather than going stale.
